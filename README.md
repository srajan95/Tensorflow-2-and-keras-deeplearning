# Tensorflow-2-and-keras-deeplearning
We'll focus on understanding the latest updates to TensorFlow and leveraging the Keras API (TensorFlow 2.0's official API) to quickly and easily build models.
We will build models to forecast future price homes, classify medical images, predict future sales data, generate complete new text artificially and much more!

## The topics covered will be
NumPy Crash Course
Pandas Data Analysis Crash Course
Data Visualization Crash Course
Neural Network Basics
TensorFlow Basics
Keras Syntax Basics
Artificial Neural Networks
Densely Connected Networks
Convolutional Neural Networks
Recurrent Neural Networks
AutoEncoders
GANs - Generative Adversarial Networks
Deploying TensorFlow into Production

Keras, a user-friendly API standard for machine learning, will be the central high-level API used to build and train models. The Keras API makes it easy to get started with TensorFlow 2. Importantly, Keras provides several model-building APIs (Sequential, Functional, and Subclassing), so we can choose the right level of abstraction for the project. TensorFlowâ€™s implementation contains enhancements including eager execution, for immediate iteration and intuitive debugging, and tf.data, for building scalable input pipelines.

TensorFlow 2 makes it easy to take new ideas from concept to code, and from model to publication. TensorFlow 2.0 incorporates a number of features that enables the definition and training of state of the art models without sacrificing speed or performance

It is used by major companies all over the world, including Airbnb, Ebay, Dropbox, Snapchat, Twitter, Uber, SAP, Qualcomm, IBM, Intel, and of course, Google!
